# Stage 1: Builder
FROM rust:slim-bookworm AS builder

# Update apt and install necessary build dependencies
# - pkg-config: Helps Rust crates find C libraries
# - libssl-dev: OpenSSL development headers
# - build-essential: Provides gcc, g++, make (for compiling C/C++ dependencies)
# - cmake: Often required by C/C++ build scripts
# - librdkafka-dev: Development headers for the librdkafka C library
# - libcurl4-openssl-dev: Development headers for libcurl (with OpenSSL support)
# - libsasl2-dev: Development headers for SASL (required by librdkafka for authentication)
# - zlib1g-dev: Development headers for zlib (compression library)
# - libgmp-dev: Development headers for GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library), often needed by crypto libraries
# - libpq-dev: PostgreSQL client library development files (CRITICAL - this was missing!)
